# Strategy-Driven Algorithmic Trading Engine

## Overview
A modular, object-oriented algorithmic trading system designed for quantitative research, strategy development, and paper-trading simulation.  
The project focuses on clean separation between market data ingestion, strategy logic, and execution handling.

## Features
- Strategy abstraction for quantitative signal generation
- Simple Moving Average (SMA) based intraday trading strategy
- Paper trading execution engine with capital and position tracking
- Real-time market data ingestion using Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Extensible architecture for adding new strategies and instruments

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- pandas, numpy
- yfinance

## System Architecture
1. Market data is fetched at intraday frequency using Yahoo Finance
2. SMA indicators are computed on OHLC price data
3. Trading signals (BUY / SELL / HOLD) are generated by the strategy module
4. Orders are executed via a simulated trading engine
5. Capital, open positions, and trade state are continuously tracked
